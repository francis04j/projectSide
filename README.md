# projectSide
Practice side project for backend development using node.js, javascript, typescript, cloud, microservices

Project is based on a Car Rental Platform that allows users to 
 - to submit a car up for rent. 
 - to pay to rent a car
 - to trade a car for another car.
 
This project should conform to SOLID principle, Automated Testing, Continuous deployment and Cloud support.

TO ensure efficiency and availability, we will also support CAP theorem

We will be introducing 
 - a caching layer
 - a message queue
 - a nofitication system
 - a frontend service, i.e. gateway
 - SAST (static testing involves stripping off non-functional code like node_modules,tests,docs,confgiration file and send them to veracode)
 - DAST (dynamic applicaton secuirty testing via BURP suite pro)
